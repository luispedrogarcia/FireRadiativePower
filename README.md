# FireRadiativePower
Research thesis code <br>
<b> Introduction <b>
Increasing fire in the Western US [1] has led to increased interested in wildfire emissions, including carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, nitrogen oxides, and aerosols [2-5]. Fire emissions have imporant impacts on atmospheric chemistry, radiative forcing, and local and regional air quality.
Fire Radiative Power (FRP) measured using remotely sensed data provides a means for quantifying burned biomass and estimating fire emissions. FRP has been utilized in examples such as quantifying burned biomass in the Amazonian region of Brazil [6], and even for assessing gas flaring heat from industries [7]. FRP is based on Planck's function, which explains the spectral radiance distribution of a theoretical blackbody as a function of temperature. The parameterization of FRP can be seen in the 'FRP Formulation' section.
